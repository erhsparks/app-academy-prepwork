## Hi A/a people!

Because the Jumpstart blogger had us add to github, it doesn't push to this repository -- you'll see it as a black folder in [w4](./w4/). It's available at [erhsparks/app_academy_prep_blogger][blogger].

Folder hierarchy is kept pretty much intact as I assume you'll want to run the specs for all of my solutions! Most of the extra A/a .md files and the [A/a solutions](./solutions/) folder have been moved to [w0](./w0/), so that I can keep a copy of everything in one place but it's not cluttering up the main page here.

The only things I didn't get to were:  

- the maze solver: I'm going to work on that this week, I just wanted to get this turned in so I could schedule a final interview/not procrastinate forever.  

- some of the bonus battleships options: I added the canonical ships but didn't get to making it a two player game. ...yet. ;)

This was super fun and I hope you enjoy playing the w3 games!
